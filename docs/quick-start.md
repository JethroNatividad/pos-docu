# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the POS with Inventory Management System! This quick start guide provides a summary of the most important steps to get you up and running with the system.

## Step 1: Set Up Inventory

1. **Create Stock Entries**: Start by adding stock entries for your ingredients or products. Specify the type, perishable status, and set stock warnings for low inventory.
   
2. **Add or Remove Stock**: Once the stock is created, you can easily add new stock or remove it as needed. Track stock in batches for better management.

## Step 2: Create Recipes

1. **Create a Recipe**: Define your recipes with a name, description, and image. Specify ingredients and serving sizes.

2. **Set Pricing**: For each serving size, set a price, and the system will calculate costs and profits automatically.

## Step 3: Add Orders in POS

1. **Select Recipe**: From the POS, click "Add to Order" to select a recipe and serving size.
   
2. **Customize Order**: Add any optional add-ons and confirm the order.
   
3. **Checkout**: At checkout, enter customer details, payment method, and any discounts. A printable receipt will be generated.

## Step 4: Manage Users

1. **Create Users**: As an admin, you can create users with different roles such as Cashier, Inventory Manager, Store Manager, or Admin.

2. **Assign Roles**: Ensure each user has the appropriate role for their responsibilities.
