# Inventory Management

Inventory management is a critical part of the POS system. Hereâ€™s how to manage stock entries and ensure your inventory stays up to date.

## Create Stock Entry

To manage inventory, you can create a stock entry with the following details:
- **Name**: The name of the stock item.
- **Description**: A short description of the item.
- **Type**: The type of item (Powder, Liquid, or Item).
- **Perishable**: Specify whether the item is perishable. If yes, set a warning for when the item is near expiration.
- **Stock Warning**: Set a warning threshold for low stock based on the unit type (e.g., grams, liters, pieces).

## Stock Entry Actions

You can perform the following actions on stock entries:
- **Add Stock**: Enter the batch, quantity, and price of new stock.
- **Remove Stock**: Remove stock by selecting the batch, entering the quantity, and providing a reason.
- **Edit Stock**: Modify details of existing stock entries.
- **Delete Stock**: Remove a stock entry entirely (if stock is available to delete).
